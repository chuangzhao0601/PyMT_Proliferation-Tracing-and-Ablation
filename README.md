# Modeling Tumor Relapse Using Proliferation Tracing and Ablation Transgenic Mouse

This repository contains the source data and source codes for bioinformatic analysis. The paper was published in npj Breast Cancer.

we employed a dual recombinase-mediated genetic system to genetically trace and ablate proliferating cells in a Polyoma Virus middle T antigen (PyMT)-induced spontaneous murine breast cancer model. This system enabled the acute ablation of cells that had undergone proliferation within a defined time window, resulting in a drastic tumor shrinkage, followed by a gradual tumor relapse due to the presence of residual low-cycling cells. We then applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to unbiasedly compare the tumor ecosystems of the primary and relapsed PyMT tumors
